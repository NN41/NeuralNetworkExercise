Conclusions
- We use a neural network with one hidden layer to solve a non-linear binary classification problem, based on the make_moons dataset from sklearn. For the activation function we experiment using none, relu, sigmoid and tanh.
- Using no activation function, the NN is simply a linear function of its 2d inputs, unable to learn the non-linearities of the make_moons dataset. The lowest test loss it can achieve is 0.31 with an accuracy of 84%. It doesn't matter how many hidden units you use, it will never achieve better than results this, logically.
- Increasing the number of hidden units generally makes the models converge quicker to their best possible test loss. This is because, with more hidden units, you have more weights to adjust per SGD step, which significantly improves the distance you can move towards the test loss minimum. However, this depends on the learning rate. As you keep increasing the number of weights while keeping the lr fixed, you might start overshooting the minimum test loss, leading to unstable learning. For activation = none, you see this happen at 512 hidden units, where the performance is very unstable and non-monotonic and we quite never reach the 0.31 minimum test loss, suggesting we keep overshooting. Starting with 1 hidden unit, we reach 0.31 after epoch 64, all the way down to epoch 8 at 256 hidden units.
- Interestingly, I was expecting tanh and sigmoid to behave rather similarly, but it is clear that tanh converges way quicker than sigmoid. This is because tanh is zero-centered (tanh(0)=0) while sigmoid(0)=1/2. Being zero-centered allows for gradient updates of weights in separate, independent directions, since around 0, tanh will be either positive or negative. On the other hand, since sigmoid around 0 is always positive, weights will also be update way more often in lockstep in the same direction, leading to poorer learning performance or overshooting. Consider for example this 1-hidden layer MLP with a pre-hidden activation of z=0. Let's say we want to update the weights W leading into the output layer. The gradient of W is proportional to the hidden activations h(0). For sigmoid, h(0)~0.5, so all weights in W get adjusted into the same direction, whereas for tanh, h(0)~0, so some weights in W get adjusted in the positive direction, while others in the negative direction. Another, less important difference is that the derivative of tanh around 0 is roughly 1, while for sigmoid it is smaller at 0.25. All in all, tanh resembles the identity activation around 0, which means that the NN maintains a lot of beneficial properties of linear functions for training. A third reason why tanh performs better, is that doesn't saturate to 0 for negative values, but it saturates towards -1. The gradients of subsequent layer weights (so the weights leading into the output layer) depend on the activation of the hidden layer. For sigmoid, this can be saturated towards 0, which means that the gradient signal will stop flowing through this neuron AT THIS ACTIVATION. The tanh, would be saturated towards -1, which means that you can still update the weights.
- ReLU is the clear winner. It needs only a few hidden layers to be able to learn the non-linearity. With 8 hidden neurons it can achieve 100% accuracy after 1000 epochs. Clearly, 1 hidden layer is not going to enough, since this is just a handicapped linear model. For 2 layers, we already get an outperformance of an identity activation. My hypothesis is that with N hidden layers in this MLP, you can get an O(2^N)-piece piecewise linear decision boundary. So 2 layers would technically be enough to learn the make moons decently, but it seems that it just gets stuck in a local optimum that it cannot get out of (going left to right, the decision boundary learns the initial smoothness, but then runs out of linear pieces to make the rest of the bends, just gives up and pulls a straight line).
